This Github page provides code and data for reproducing the results in the manuscript:``Estimating Direct and Indirect Treatment Effects and Ranking Treatment Regimens in Space-Time Dependent Cluster Randomized Trials: A Schistosomiasis Case Study'' by Y. Chen, X. Wen, F. Luo, Y. Yang, and Y. Shen. 

## Datasets of Schistosomiasis from SCORE Project
Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical parasitic disease, is prevalent in Africa, South America, and Asia − especially in rural areas with poor socioeconomic conditions (Hong et al., 2022) − with cases reported in more than 70 countries (World Health Organization, 2022).  In 2021 alone, at least 251 million people required preventive treatment (World Health Organization, 2023). Global efforts to control morbidity have primarily focused on preventive chemotherapy using praziquantel (PZQ), typically delivered through Mass Drug Administration (MDA) via School-Based Treatment (SBT) or Community-Wide Treatment (CWT).

- We analyze individual data on Schistosoma mansoni infection from 149 villages in Kenya and 149 villages in Tanzania, covering a wide age range from 5 to 77 years.
- These infection data, collected on a yearly scale, were obtained through the SCORE project over a 5-year period from 2011 to 2015
- This project involves a CRT with six arms
- Each arm received one of three treatment options (SBT, CWT, or no treatment) annually from the first to the fourth year

## The Goal of this study
For space-time dependent cluster randomized trials, our goal is to achieve accurate and efficient estimation for direct and indirect treatment effects, aiming at helping program managers discern the differences between these treatment options.
